# Blameless Retros:

## From Errors and Outcomes → System Design

### By Alessia Bellisario

---

# Agenda

### Why a blameless retro?

- "Just Culture"
- First stories vs. Second stories
- Hindsight Bias and Fundamental Attribution Error

---

## "Just Culture"

- Philosophy and framework borrowed from the world of healthcare
- In October 1999, Dr. Lucian Leape briefed US Congress on the state of human error management in the medical industry

---

- Problem:
  - 1MM+ people injured by errors in treatment at hospitals each year in the US
  - 120,000 deaths arising from those errors at a cost of 33B
  - 3x greater than those who die in automobile accidents
  - 1000x greater than those who die in commercial aircraft accidents
  - Only 2 to 3% of major errors reported through hospital incident reporting systems
- Health care workers often report only what they cannot conceal

---

## Just Culture, cont'd

- Dr. Leape testified that the single greatest impediment to error prevention is that

> **“...we punish people for making mistakes.”** ([source](http://www.chpso.org/sites/main/files/file-attachments/marx_primer.pdf))

- "The just culture is a learning culture that is constantly improving and oriented toward patient safety." ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3776518/))
- Requires a change in focus from errors and outcomes → system design

## First stories vs. Second stories

# Situations, not people, cause errors

---

## First stories vs. Second stories cont'd

| First stories                                                               | Second stories                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human error is seen as cause of failure                                     | Human error is seen as the effect of systemic vulnerabilities deeper inside the organization                           |
| Saying what people should have done is a satisfying way to describe failure | Saying what people should have done doesn’t explain why it made sense for them to do what they did                     |
| Telling people to be more careful will make the problem go away             | Only by constantly seeking out its vulnerabilities can organizations enhance safety (or reliability, resilience, etc.) |

## Hindsight Bias and Fundamental Attribution Error

- **[Hindsight Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias)**: the common tendency for people to perceive events that have already occurred as having been more predictable than they actually were before the events took place
- **[Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error)**: people tend to unduly emphasize internal characteristics (character or intention), rather than external factors, in explaining other people's behavior, but not our own

---

## Blameless Retros

- Seek out Second stories ("the story behind the story," or vulnerabilities in the system)
- Understand **how** something happened, not "why" (the answer to "why" is often a cause-and-effect chain that gets created after the fact by virtue of hindsight)
  - [Look for descriptions, not explanations](https://github.com/etsy/DebriefingFacilitationGuide/blob/master/guide/05-the-art-of-asking-questions.md#remember-to-look-for-descriptions-not-explanations)
- Encourage people who do make mistakes to be the experts on educating the rest of the organization how not to make them in the future
